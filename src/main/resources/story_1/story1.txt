As an API consumer, I want to be able to create a new customer in our system via an API so that I can efficiently manage customer information programmatically.
Acceptance Criteria:

1. Given I have valid authentication credentials:
	When I send an HTTP POST request to the /customers endpoint with the following payload:

	JSON

	{

	    "firstName": "John",

	    "middleName": "Doe",

	    "lastName": "Smith",

	    "addressLine1": "123 Main St",

	    "city": "Anytown",

	    "country": "United States",

	    "postalCode": "12345",

	    "phoneNumber": "+1 555-123-4567",

	    "emailAddress": "john.doe@example.com"

	}



	Then the API should create a new customer record.

	And return an HTTP 201 (Created) status code.

	And include the newly created customerâ€™s unique identifier (e.g., customerId) in the response body.

2. Given I provide incomplete or invalid data in the request payload:

	When I send an HTTP POST request to the /customers endpoint with missing or incorrect fields:

	Then the API should return an appropriate error response (e.g., HTTP 400 Bad Request).

	And provide clear error messages indicating the missing or invalid data.

3. Given a customer profile is successfully created:

	When I retrieve customer details via an HTTP GET request to the /customers/{customerId} endpoint:

	Then the API should return accurate customer information matching the data provided during creation.

4. Given I search for the newly created customer:

	When I send an HTTP GET request to the /customers/search?email=john.doe@example.com endpoint:

	Then the API should return the correct customer profile.
