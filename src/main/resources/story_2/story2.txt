As an API consumer, I want to be able to update customer information via an API while ensuring that the first name and last name remain unchanged.

Acceptance Criteria:

Given I have valid authentication credentials:

When I send an HTTP PUT or PATCH request to the /customers/{customerId} endpoint with the following payload (example for updating the address):

JSON

{

    "addressLine1": "456 Elm Street",

    "city": "Newville",

    "country": "United States",

    "postalCode": "54321",

    "phoneNumber": "+1 555-987-6543",

    "emailAddress": "john.doe@example.com"

}

Then the API should update the customer record.

And return an HTTP 200 (OK) status code.

And ensure that the first name and last name remain unchanged.

Given I provide incomplete or invalid data in the request payload:

When I send an HTTP PUT or PATCH request to the /customers/{customerId} endpoint with missing or incorrect fields:

Then the API should return an appropriate error response (e.g., HTTP 400 Bad Request).

And provide clear error messages indicating the missing or invalid data.

Given the customer profile is successfully updated:

When I retrieve customer details via an HTTP GET request to the /customers/{customerId} endpoint:

Then the API should return accurate customer information, including the updated fields.

Given I search for the updated customer:

When I send an HTTP GET request to the /customers/search?email=john.doe@example.com endpoint:

Then the API should return the correct customer profile.
